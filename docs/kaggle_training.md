# Kaggle Training

This project can now train on Kaggle while still using Hugging Face as the system of record for:

- the dataset repo
- the resumable checkpoint history
- the target model repo

## What Kaggle Does

The Kaggle kernel does not ship a separate training stack.
It clones this GitHub repo at runtime and executes:

`scripts/train_daily_from_hf.py`

That means the Kaggle run:

- downloads `NorthernTribe-Research/maasai-translation-corpus` from HF
- restores the latest checkpoint from the configured Hugging Face model repo (`HF_MODEL_REPO`; default workflow fallback is `NorthernTribe-Research/maasai-en-mt-staging`)
- trains with the current generation-aware mixture
- pushes checkpoints and final adapter artifacts back to HF

## Files Added

- `kaggle/train_and_push.py`
- `kaggle/requirements-kaggle.txt`
- `scripts/push_kaggle_kernel.py`

## Required Secrets

There are three different secret delivery modes available.

### Local machine

Use root-level `kaggle.json` for the Kaggle API on your machine.
This is used only to push/update the Kaggle kernel from local development.

You can also use `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and `KAGGLE_KEY` environment variables instead of `kaggle.json`.

### Kaggle runtime

Inside Kaggle itself, add this secret in the notebook UI:

- `HF_TOKEN`

Optional:

- `WANDB_API_KEY`

If you push the kernel with `--report-to wandb` and a local root-level `wandb-keys.json`
exists, the helper will embed that W&B key into the Kaggle kernel package.
That is local-only behavior and the file remains gitignored.

### GitHub Actions

The GitHub workflow can also embed secrets directly into the private kernel package from environment variables.

Required GitHub secrets:

- `KAGGLE_USERNAME`
- `KAGGLE_KEY`
- `HF_TOKEN`

Optional:

- `WANDB_API_KEY`

`HF_TOKEN` must have access to the base model if it is gated and must have permission to push to your configured model repo (`HF_MODEL_REPO`).

## Local Push Flow

Install the Kaggle CLI into the project venv if needed:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install kaggle
```

Build the kernel package locally:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/push_kaggle_kernel.py
```

Push the kernel to Kaggle:

```bash
KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR="$PWD" .venv/bin/python scripts/push_kaggle_kernel.py --execute --status
```

Or use the retrying wrapper, which keeps rerunning when Kaggle assigns an unsupported P100 / Pascal GPU:

```bash
KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR="$PWD" .venv/bin/python scripts/run_kaggle_training.py \
  --max-attempts 5 \
  --report-to wandb \
  --embed-local-hf-token
```

## GitHub Actions Flow

The scheduled GitHub workflow now calls `scripts/run_kaggle_training.py` on `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404` by default (or the label configured in `TRAINING_CONTROL_RUNNER_LABEL`).

That workflow:

- authenticates to Kaggle with `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and `KAGGLE_KEY`
- passes the current GitHub repository and branch into the kernel config
- embeds `HF_TOKEN` into the private kernel package with `--embed-env-hf-token`
- optionally embeds `WANDB_API_KEY`
- pushes the kernel and waits until Kaggle reaches real training startup

This makes GitHub the control plane while Kaggle remains the GPU execution backend.

## Default Kernel Target

By default the helper creates:

- slug: `maasai-daily-hf-training`
- title: `Maasai Daily HF Training`

The kernel is private by default and GPU + internet are enabled.

## Useful Overrides

Example:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/push_kaggle_kernel.py \
  --kernel-slug maasai-hf-nightly \
  --title "Maasai HF Nightly" \
  --max-steps 1200 \
  --report-to wandb
```

## Runtime Notes

- Kaggle GPU sessions are time-limited, so the HF checkpoint resume path matters.
- The default kernel profile is translation-only and passes `--no-augment-with-generation-tasks` unless you override it.
- The default base model is `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct` so the Kaggle runtime is not blocked on gated-model approval.
- The default kernel profile now uses `batch_size=1` and `gradient_accumulation_steps=32`, and it does not require 4-bit unless you explicitly push with `--require-4bit`.
- If Kaggle assigns a Tesla P100 / Pascal GPU, the current PyTorch build may not support that architecture. The trainer now fails early with an explicit rerun-on-T4/L4 message instead of crashing deep in model load.
- `scripts/run_kaggle_training.py` watches the Kaggle run, downloads the current log, and automatically retries when that unsupported-GPU marker appears.
- If Kaggle shows the run as failed immediately, the first thing to check is whether `HF_TOKEN` was added in Kaggle secrets.
